Nowdays advertisements occupy an important place in our life, I would hardly dare say a fundamental one. Everywhere we turn, at home, in our cities, in the shops, in the cinemas, advertisement is present, sometimes oppressing us, or just irritating us .
Not long ago, I had been deeply irritated by two particular advertisements: one was the * American Eagle * advertisement, a famous brand of gym shoes, in which everybody walks completely naked; and another one in general * The Kinder * advertisement in which it is shown us the life, the happy and healthy life, of all the people who buy this brand of brioches .
Trying to do an analysis of these advertisements, we can say that in the first case people are completely naked in order to concentrate our attention on the shoes. In fact, if we have only the shoes to look at, we are, in a certain way, obliged to look at them .
In the second case there is the association of good life with that specific brand of brioches. Everybody, mothers, sons, fathers eat them, becoming a sort of garantee for us .
However these two advertisements can't be different from how they have been shown to us. The campaigns, in fact, use some of the most common expedients in the advertisement world: the sex, in the first campaign, which has become essential for advertisement, through which many campaigns represent their products .
The image of quietness and happiness in the second campaign, which are so desired but, in the same time, so difficult to reach .
So advertisement expresses itself through all those things which we usually want: a nice family, a satisfactory life, a good job, happy children, a beautiful house...
It is a sort of our desires glass, that tells and shows us what we really want to hear and see .
That's why, in my opinion, advertisement represents a damage: a damage to our life that, in its simplicity, remains real .
