Of course, a young man from a small village in the country says he couldn't afford not to have a car of his own because he has to get to the city for everyday's work, he wants to go out in the evening with his girlfriend at whatever time and wherever he wants to. It is also true that a busy manager or insurance man claims to need an automobile so often. And all of them say the official bus traffic system is so bad that they are required to possess an automobile, with buses and trains they can't make it .
But do they ever think of the consequences of this behaviour? Do they think of and care about the environment they live in? It is certainly clear and unquestionable that something must be done against the inundation of the world with cars. If one walks through a city - what does he see? If he has time to look around despite of the chasing traffic he will see nothing but thousands of steel monsters thundering through the streets, polluting the air. With these thousands and thousands of cars mankind faces one of its biggest problems. Car-parking and the rapidly increasing traffic puts up great problems to the cities. Thousands of accidents per year and the steadily growing pollution of the air concerns us all .
So it must be searched for alternative traffic systems which leads us to trains and buses. True, the opportunities of moving freely with these kinds are worse yet. But what if all the private and "official" money that is needed to pay the costs of car productions and driving would be put into alternative transportation systems for everbody? What if the costs for cleaning the environment and hospital costs would be reduced with the reducing or even banning of cars? Unemployment wouldn't rise also because of the many workers needed to run the new-built traffic systems .
To come to a conclusion one has to say that we ought to find new ways, that it can't go on like it is now. One of these new ways should be the banning of cars .
