Raquel, a spanish girl, is a close friend of mine. I met her on a trip to Spain I made with a friend three years ago. My friend Manfred and I went with his old Golf. We were afraid that his car could break down and he really did. It happened in the midst of Madrid with all the hustling and bustling cars, the jostling pedestrians and the cyclists hurrying to or from work. It really was an adventure to get the car off the street. The brakes had to be repaired and so we had time to stroll through Madrid, visit museums and exhibitions and sit in cosy cafés and sip coffee. We met Raquel in such a cosy, little, hidden café. We took seats at her table because she looked like a funny, charming girl from first sight. She didn't give the impression of a typical spanish girl, often very fashionable dressed and arrogant, but was dressed in blue jeans and a black sweater. When she noticed that we are germans she started talking with us and was very proud of being able to understand and speak a little bit german. She told us that she is studying english literature in Madrid and mentioned a lot of interesting places and monuments we should visit. Her eyes sparkled with joy when she talked about her home town and we could easily notice how much she loves Madrid. Raquel is a hospitable person and invited us to stay some days in the comfortable and elegant villa of her family. Manfred and I were welcommed at once in the house by the whole family: her sweet, little sister Angela, her talkative father Carlos and also her charming mother Rosy. It was obvious that Raquel had her long, mahogany-coloured curly hair from her mother. They are an intact family and live in great harmony and it was a pleasure for us to stay with them. It was really hard to say good-bye after only a few days. But from then we are friends and visit each other as often as possible. I really admire Raquel because of her merry, vivicious nature, her delicate appearance and intelligence .
