According to recent statistics published in the Stern magazine cars are the most effective way to pollute our environment: But not only the exhaust fumes, but also the fact that about 90% of all German families have at least two cars, which are thrown away regularly after approximately 2 years, made some people aware that there are too many cars in the world .
Dr. Smith, author of the article, suggested that all cars should be banned and public transport should be improved .
A friend of mine read that article and totally disagreed. He lives about 10 miles away from university and he said: "Well, in the summer it's no problem for me to go by bike to the university. But in the winter it is really too dangerous to bike with all the black ice on the streets. I would like to go by bus but the bus connection to our village is merely catastrophic. Only twice a day there is a bus to the city and back. I really prefer to go by car. I do not want to be dependent on the bus connection."
In my opinion Dr Smith is partly right. It is utter nonsense to use the car for a distance of about 50 metres to the next shop or the next mail box. If people used their cars only when necessary you would not have to bann the cars. You should only take your car if you cannot reach your destination by public transport by bike or on foot .
