The first thing that caught my eye when I met this extremely handsome, young man was the captivating, warm expression in his sparkling, deep ocean-blue eyes as they peered straight at me. Strolling towards me, his thick, shiny, golden hair glowed in the sunshine and a light, refreshing summer breeze played with his stubborn curls. His face was covered with a bunch of dark, bristly stubbles giving him a touch of adventurous toughness and, now, smiling warm and gentle tenderness. I noticed his strong and powerful, darkly tanned hands as he put down his ragged suitcase in front of me. Obviously a tourist! A mixture of the smell of cigarettes, dark coffee and "Axe" after shave made my nose tingle. And, when he finally started to speak, asking me something about the Tourist Information Center in this city, my heart missed a beat at the sound of his deep, dark and passionate voice. A flawless set of white teeth gleamed at me after I had given him the information he needed, and when he walked away, his t-shirt revealed a part of his sportive, muscled body. I was indeed very delighted about my spontaneous, witty decision since I had given him my address instead of the one he asked for. I rushed home to welcome him .
