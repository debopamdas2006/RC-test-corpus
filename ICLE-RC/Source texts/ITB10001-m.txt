 <ICLE-IT-BER-0001.10> 
A sentence like this is a trap! The first time I have read it i have thought it was quite davious, but once adventured in it I realized that I was lost in a labyrinth .
Everything began when I noticed that * poetry * and * people * have more than a meaning. Does * people * mean * degree of entruction *? In this case a person who has attended school until 20 years might be more prepared to undestand literary and historical references or to catch some metaphor just because he has been taught that every poet and every century have more or less the same way of using metaphors .
Does * people * mean * human feeling *? In this case the sentence is false. As the matter of fact poetry rises just form * human feeling *.
The reason why it is hardly comprehensible in that <?even?> starting from human feeling the poet wants to <?jake?> then towards the abstraction and the eternity, going in this way extremely far from the human sphere. If * people * means * way of using language * in theory every poet has his own personal language and symbolic system, but in practise there is something in language that we all share: it is the * emotional sense * of language, that often goes beyond every logical sense .
Poetry is not mere logic, end even if we cannot catch the exact meaning of a poetic work we sometimes can share something of the emotion the poet has felt. For instance I enjoyed some poems that I have read even if I have not understook the * meaning *. Sometimes I just appreciate the sound of the words together or the particular combination of images .
Indeed, I think that every poem, independently from what we call * meaning * projects some images in the mind of the reader, and this images are the part of poetry tha we all can understand, even if everyone in his own personal way .
Theorycally only the author can understand everything in his work, because overy poem in based on personal experience and feelings, even if it does not talk directly about them .
It happers not only in what the normally call * poetry * as * poetry * has more than a meaning ( just like * people *!). For example Baudelaire was convinced that even prose can be poetic, and I think that even in our ordinary language sometimes there is a little poetry. So, in poetry, as in prose, as in ordinary language, there are a lot of meanings that could be received .
When a writer or a speaker produces a sentence he often give possible * meaning * that he cannot imagine .
In the spoken language we probably understand more the * logical sense * that in poetry, but even in poetry we can catch the * emotional sense *, these images that the language project in our minds .
In this sense I would not say that * most people ignore most poetry * but rather I would say that * must people ignore most part of the meaning or poetry *.
Besides I would not say * must poetry ignores must people * because * poetry * is based on human feelings and on the observation of people .
It depends on the way we intend * people *. The sentence shoul be read in its context to be able to get out of the labyrinth .
