The introduction and diffusion of the so called * mass-media *, such as television for example, in the modern and industrialized society, is strictly connected with the change of the culture, the behaviour and thought of modern men .
I agree with the title of the essay, that is to say, <*> . In fact, the influence of television on the * masses * is powerful and extraordinary. Television, * the opium of the modern masses *, has developped the public opinion, that is to say, the thoughts of civil society, which has, though the use of television, all the methods of information: films, soap operas, serials, television news, documentary films, and so on. People watching television are like * voyeur * who are deeply involved with the power of persuasion and conviction of Tv .
In the 20th century, television plays and has an important and decisive role on * the modern masses *, together with the development and expansion of technology and culture. The negative aspects of television became the object of study and analysis of authours such as Herman Marcuse for example. He underlined the negative power of television on the * modern masses *, such as the aspect of alienation, of the * manipulation * of the thought and behaviour of men. However that may be, television is and has been in the past, a powerful means and source of information, which contributes to the development of the cultural emancipation of men. Television has the power * to enter * and * filter * in the houses and private lives of the * modern masses *. It is like a * magic box * which is in strict touch with the privacy of men and it shows people, for example, how to organize their free-time, their job and social life. It gives all the information people need .
Watching television gives men the opportunity for dreaming and imagination is our modern world dominated by technology and industrialization. In fact, the presence of films, thrillers, serial stories, and so on, represents the projections of our dreams and myths. Television has become the favourite pastime of both old people and children, who like to see films and cartoons, such as * Tom and Jerry *, etc. It has become an important * vehicle * of personal knowledge and information, and it underlines everything is exceptional, moving and sensational, when it presents an adventure, a story, a film or gossips of the so-called * vips *.
Television is also an important means for the political propaganda: home affairs, foreign affairs, political elections, become a television * competition *, like for example the last election of the American President of the United States Bill Clinton, of whom, television has exalted his human qualities and his private life whit his wife Hilary .
Crimes news for example, which are strictly connected with disasters, murders, accidents etc., give men topical subjects of discussion .
Television is, without any doubts, the best * means * for the divulgation of information, which marks the advent of a new era, that is to say, the modern age dominated by science technology and industrialization .
