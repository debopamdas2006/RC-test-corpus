Could I live without television? Could the world live without television? Two good questions I could hardly answer. Probably the problem is not trying to live without, but learn * how * to live with it .
* It's the end of the word...* Says William Hurt in * Until the end of the world * of Wim Wenders when all electric engines broke down because of a nuclear explosion .
It seems that a world without technology, without television means the end. I don't agree. We do decide having a good or a bad use of what we have around us .
Even children, if we helped them, can discern good and evil looking at television. It's enough not leaving them alone in front of television for hours without an explanation of what they ' re watching .
Television can be culture and it cannot be, can be truth or not, can be funny or not. Television is the world in all its littler aspects, the result of rappresentation of every part of human society and soul .
Television attracts very strong feelings and it's very difficult to comprehend what should be its role in our society .
Really I don't want to fall in the * net * of these considerations. My attitude toward television probably is simpler. I watch what I like trying to remember television, to some extent, is attempting to * conquer * me in every possible way .
But my moral and cultural integrity will no longer accept compromises, I have the power of choise and I'll use it; and in lack of it, there's no problem, I can play my guitar .
